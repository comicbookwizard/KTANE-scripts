# KTANE-scripts
A collection of simple solvers for a few of the modules in the base game of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.

Currently contains solvers for:
- [x] the Button 
- [x] Simple Wires
---
I plan to make solvers for the 
- [x] Memory
- [x] Password
- [ ] Complicated Wires
- [ ] Wire Panels
- [ ] Simon Says

and eventually combine all of these into one app. However, for now, I'm just going to post these as separate scripts as I work on them.

I wanted to do the Maze module, but that would involve me adding a path-finding algorithm. Maybe I'll do that once I get better.
